For instance, imagine a small application with a straightforward requirement—like displaying different types of alerts. If the logic is simple (e.g., a basic if-else or switch statement), introducing a design pattern like Strategy (to encapsulate each alert behavior) or Factory (to create different alert objects) might add unnecessary layers of abstraction. Instead of making the code more flexible, it could become harder to read and maintain due to extra classes, interfaces, and delegation logic.

The added complexity might be justified in a large, evolving system where future changes are expected. But for small, stable features, the overhead of a pattern can outweigh its benefits. The principle of "keeping it simple" suggests that if a problem doesn’t require advanced flexibility or scalability, a direct, minimal solution is often better. Overusing patterns can lead to bloated code, slower development, and confusion for other developers who expect simplicity where it’s due.
